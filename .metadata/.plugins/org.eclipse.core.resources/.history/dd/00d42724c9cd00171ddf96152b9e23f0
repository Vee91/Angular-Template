Something went wrong!!!!!! <br />

You are not meeting the eligibility criteria to apply for leave. <br />
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 50px;">
This may be on account of:<br />
(1) You not having completed requirements of minimum duration spent in the country<br />
(2) Your employment status which may be LWP, resigned / serving notice period, etc. due to which you are not eligible for leave, or<br />
(3) Missing employee details in the system (incomplete deputation formalities, incorrect assignment duration, incorrect visa status, etc.).<br />

Please connect with your HR for further clarity and assistance.
